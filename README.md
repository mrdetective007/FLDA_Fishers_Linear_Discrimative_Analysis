## Introduction

Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) is a technique used for feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and classification. It aims to find a projection that maximizes the separation between different classes while minimizing the variance within each class. This repository provides hands-on examples and explanations of FLDA concepts.

- [Notebook 1] Introduction to Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdetective007/FLDA_Fishers_Linear_Discrimative_Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the `Fishers_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis` directory:

cd FLDA_Fishers_Linear_Discrimative_Analysis/Fishers_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Explore and run the notebooks to learn about Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis.

## Dataset

The notebooks use a sample dataset for classification tasks. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed within each notebook for training, dimensionality reduction, and evaluation.

## Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis

FLDA involves finding a linear projection that maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter. It aims to project data points onto a lower-dimensional space that best separates different classes.

## Training and Classification

The notebooks demonstrate how to apply FLDA for dimensionality reduction and classification. They explain how to train classifiers using the reduced features and evaluate their performance.

## Conclusion

This repository provides insights into Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis and its application in dimensionality reduction and classification. By following the notebooks, you can gain a solid foundation in this technique.
